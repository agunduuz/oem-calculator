# 💰 Calculate Products! 📊

I wanted to create an application where we can perform CRUD operations. To prevent code complexity, I divided the code into separate modules for better code organization. 
Additionally, I utilized LocalStorage and escaped from a scattered structure using JavaScript patterns. 🧩✨

The languages I used are:

- **HTML 🌐**
- **CSS 🎨**
- **JavaScript 💻**
